# Code Quiz

## Description

The aim of the challenge was to create an interactive quiz.

My motivation going into this project was to develop my understaning of the DOM and how to manipulate it, something I have struggled to with. I also aimed to gain experience storing and accessing local storage, a concept that was completely new to me. Finally, I wanted to spend a lot more time on the pseudo code, taking time to organise my thoughts before diving in. 


Upon completing the project, I found the DOM aspects relatively straight forward and the pseudoCode was helpful when I get stuck, something I will be sticking. Although I believe I got there in the end, I struggled with local storage and will definitely need to practice this more.

## Usage

Open Web Page, sound will automatically play so feel free to toggle. It gets annoying after a while!

Answer questions. Save your score with initials. Initials must be 2 or 3 letters. I have chosen to allow for multiple highscores of the same user initials.
